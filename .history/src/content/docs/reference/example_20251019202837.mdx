import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Project Structure

Below is our project structure:

<FileTree>
  - src/ - pages/ - index.astro - components/ - Button.astro - package.json -
  README.md/ - components/
</FileTree>

## Additional Content

Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.
