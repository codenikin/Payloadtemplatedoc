  🧠 What Redis Does in Bulk WhatsApp Sending.Redis is often used with queue
  systems like Redis Queue. Each message to be sent is stored as a job in
  Redis.Redis stores all these jobs in memory (very fast) and lets workers
  process them one by one or in batches.
  <br />
  👉 Benefit: - Prevents your VPS or WhatsApp session from crashing when sending
  thousands of messages at once. - Helps distribute the load across multiple
  workers or servers.
